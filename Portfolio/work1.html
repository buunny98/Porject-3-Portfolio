        <p class="about PP1 wh">Designing a website for a customized cake shop is always fun. I was creating a project
            which
            involved building a <br> website for a cake shop. The name of the shop was Shyama’s cake Design. In the
            beginning, I started off with a style <br>guide that had all my elements ready to go for my final version of
            the
            website, for example, font, text-elements, button designs etc.

            Design Choices & Challenges
        </h1>
        <hr>

        <p class="about PP1 wh1">I went with a much soft look for the website light colours, serif fonts and center
            alignment of the text. I wanted to make my website look more informative rather than throwing pictures all
            over my website.

            After building my style guide I went on and started building the website. While making the website I
            realized keeping only the pink colour on the whole website made the website look less punchy and contrasty
            to the user. I ended up adding the Navy-blue colour for the navigation bar on the website. I also wanted to
            make the home page look animative so I ended up adding a gif which made the website look more versatile.<br>
            <br>
            There were a couple of challenges that I had to face while designing and making the website, the website had
            a lot of buttons, labels & textarea’s for the user to suggest what kind of cake the user wants, making the
            website responsive with those labels and buttons was a huge challenge. Every time I made the screen smaller
            than 300px the labels and buttons went off the screen. In the end, I was able to fix those by adding a lot
            of media queries on the buttons for every 50px I added one query to make the button and label smaller so
            that it does not go outside of the window. After all that effort, the end result was great and the website
            was looking CakeElicious.
